The REAMDE specific to the Wireshark "copy" of the pidl sources
==============================================================

The tree tools/pidl is a direct extract from

	svn://svnanon.samba.org/samba/branches/SAMBA_4_0/source/pidl

to allow building Wireshark pidl dissectors without having to
*explicitly* access a remote svn repository.

Don't do changes in the tools/pidl directory, do them at the samba tree!
Changes to this tree will be overwritten the next time the sources from
the samba tree are updated, which is basically every time you do an svn
up in the Wireshark toplevel dir.

In order to build, install yapp, then do

	perl Makefile.PL && make && && make install

This will build and install the binaries and the manpage (pidl.1).

Yapp can be found in CPAN at

	http://search.cpan.org/~fdesar/Parse-Yapp/

If you are using Linux, there may be a package for Yapp for your
distribution; on SUSE, the package is an rpm named perl-Parse-Yapp.

Run pidl with:

	pidl --ws-parser -- <idl-file>  (don't forget the "--")

If you run outside the dissectors/pidl directory, this *will* result in a
warning such as:

	atsvc.idl:5:23: idl_types.h: No such file or directory

and *may* result in additional warnings such as:

	Warning: No conformance file `initshutdown.cnf'
	Unable to handle string with flags STR_LEN4|STR_NOTERM at /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.6/Parse/Pidl/Wireshark/NDR.pm line 283.
